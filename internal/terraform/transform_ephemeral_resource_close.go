// ephemeralResourceCloseTransformer is a graph transformer that inserts
// a [nodeEphemeralResourceClose] node for each ephemeral resource whose "open"
// is represented by at least one existing node, and arranges for the close
// node to depend on the open node and on any other node that consumes the
// relevant ephemeral resource.
//
// This transformer also prunes nodes for any ephemeral resources that have
// no consumers for the given walk operation. In particular this means that
// Terraform will not open any instances of an ephemeral resource that is
// only used in resource provisioners if the graph is not being built for the
// apply phase, because only the apply phase actually executes provisioners.
//
// This transformer must run after any other transformer that might introduce
// an ephemeral resource node into the graph, or that might given an existing
// node information it needs to properly announce any ephemeral resources it
// consumes.
